      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">When I began teaching at Roosevelt High School, I wanted to lay out a coding foundation for students. I believe that all students should learn how to code in our 21st century world. How can we expect our children to be successful in a digital environment without the accompanying knowledge base?</p>
      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">I didn't always start out as a coder. In fact, I first learned how to code by looking at the source code of web pages and applying scientific process. I removed and added different lines of code and watched how the final product responded. From that, I gained a rudementary understanding that evolved into taking formal classes in college.</p>
      <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">My goal now is to teach your child the foundations of coding so he or she can be a more capable adult in the future. This is my passion and purpose. I hope you will support us.</p>
